        Study name:
        Prospective analysis of inter-observer and intra-observer variability in standardized lung ultrasound of patients
        with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV 2.
      </p>

      <p>
        Context & Purpose:
        Lung ultrasound (LUS) is known for 15-20 years especially in point-of-care (POC) application in intensive care
        units and emergency room. Recently in context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic it has received even more attention.
        Advantages include reducing ionizing radiation (vs CT), less transport of critically ill patients (better for
        patient as transport always is a risk and in terms of contamination also better for stuff in radiology and people
        crossing while transporting), done by treating physician (direct feedback), and other. Also, ARDS/viral pneumonia
        in COVID-19 seems to affect mostly peripheral lung areas, which can easily be displayed on LUS. Also in terms of
        pandemics more stuff that didnâ€™t use such techniques before will be new users. (many sources online).
      </p>

      <p>
        As such, it is important to know how reproducible such diagnostic and progress examinations are. We attempt to let
        experienced (lung) ultrasound users (observers=readers=users) analyze loops of COVID-19 lung ultrasound images to
        assess inter- and intra-observer variability.
